  - {rscadd: Overmap Mechanics have been overhauled}
  - {rscadd: Interactions; you can now choose where exactly to dock and how to dock.}
  - {rscadd: Suns should be actually dangerous to go near}

  - {code_imp: Framework for ship to ship docking}
  - {code_imp: Overmap code is much more modular and robust now.}
