changes:
  - rscadd: Planets now can (and will) play a sound when you land on them
  - rscadd: Gas / Plasma giants, cold, dockable worlds with absolutely no livable
      surfaces. As a matter of fact it's all chasm. All highly pressurized, gas rich,
      chasm.
  - rscadd: Dust storms and carp storms now grace the sector.
  - rscadd: physical storms (dust, carp, asteroid), will now only trigger if you go
      through them too fast. Take it easy and you might get through unscathed.
  - rscadd: planets will now have a name on the overmap
  - rscadd: overmap hazards now have a description
  - tweak: Space carp can now survive in hyperspace, their natural habitat
  - balance: minor and moderate electrical storms will no longer Explode you
  - balance: asteroid storm lists have been trimmed of Extremely Deadly ones
  - bugfix: restores planet naming behavior, I believe this was unintentionally removed
      at some point
  - bugfix: Ion storms work again. Fuck you whoever touched them last.
  - soundadd: planet_landing_1 and planet_landing_2,  (tech_notification and sos_morse_code
      from CM respectively. I don't know how to attribute properly please tell me
      how if you have issue with this attribution because I did not make these sounds
      they're from Colonial Marines)
