changes:
  - bugfix: Map exporting now no longer crops off the bottom row of tiles
  - tweak: Map exporting now saves all items a carbon/human has and dumps them on
      the floor where they were.
  - tweak: Less overzealous CHECK_TICKing of the map exporter to make it not slow
      as heck- benchmarking to see if this is worth it or not incomplete
