changes:
  - rscadd: blocking something now starts a short timer before you can block something
      again, unless you're using a shield.
  - balance: Block Chances have been altered (usually decreased) across the board.
      In tandem with the cooldown, don't expect to block as much automatic weaponry,
      while still being alright against slow attacks.
