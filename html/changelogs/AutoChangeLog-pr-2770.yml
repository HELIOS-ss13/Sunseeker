  - {tweak: Identification Cards are now Access Cards. The only real difference is
      that your name only shows up on a double examine.}
  - {refactor: 'Anonymous mechanics. Characters no longer instantly recognize each
      other, and need to properly memorize each other in order. You can recognize
      an unmasked person by ctrl-shift-clicking them.'}
delete-after: true
