changes:
  - admin: The call-shuttle and cancel-shuttle verbs have been replaced with initiate_jump
      and cancel_jump respectively.
  - admin: You can actually open check-antagonists again to delay the round \o/
  - rscdel: Emergency shuttle code
  - rscdel: Personal objectives. I am quite sure this was broken already anyways.
  - rscdel: Lots of unrelated shuttle map files and templates.
  - rscdel: A lot of antagonist objective code has been removed (as it didn't work
      at all already)
  - rscdel: AIs can no longer randomly initiate a shuttle call
  - rscdel: Normal cargo shuttle consoles have been removed, as they do not work.
      Express consoles remain.
  - rscdel: The old and deprecated shuttle consoles have been removed as they do not
      work.
  - rscdel: Bluespace gigabeacons have been removed since they do not work.
  - rscdel: Emergency shuttle purchasing has been removed. Not that it worked at all
      anyways.
  - rscdel: Removed unbuyable shuttle config for obvious reasons seen in the entry
      above.
  - tweak: Express cargo consoles no longer require you to unlock them.
  - tweak: Express cargo consoles' "cargo bay" option will now actually send pods
      to your current ship's cargo bay.
  - tweak: Export scanners no longer need to be "linked" to a cargo shuttle console.
  - tweak: Moved whiteship map files into the shiptest directory as they're normal
      ships now.
