changes:
  - rscadd: A new system for ship flight, where you only point a direction and set
      the throttle to change your speed, reducing the need for spam-clicking.
  - bugfix: There's now a maximum and minimum speed, 600spm and 0.01spm, respectively.
      The limits have been broken all this time.
