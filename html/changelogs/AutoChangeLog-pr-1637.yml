changes:
  - bugfix: Ruins don't sometimes start in hard vacuum anymore; planet turfs now share
      atmos correctly.
  - bugfix: There hopefully shouldn't be any random stray objects sitting in the edges
      of planets anymore.
  - bugfix: Planets now (hopefully) have the correct baseturfs (more or less). When
      you bomb a ruin on a planet, it probably won't break through to space anymore.
  - refactor: Planet generation has been refactored, improving performance somewhat.
