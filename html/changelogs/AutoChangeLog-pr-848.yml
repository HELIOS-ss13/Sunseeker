changes:
  - rscadd: Turfs can now be ignited and will slowly burn, igniting anyone on them
  - rscadd: Hotspots have 30% chance to ignite a turf, making fiery explosions leave
      cool residual flame.
  - balance: Flamethrowers have been reworked to use chemicals instead and now leave
      fire and hotspots on the turfs. They require an open reagent container instead
      of plasma tank now.
  - balance: Firealarms now trigger from 80C upwards (from 200C) or -10C downwards
      (from -3C). They also trigger immediately when they're on a turf fire
