  - {rscadd: "Outpost 1 has been remapped into something fathomably less ass. It's
      a bit smaller, probably, but I'm going to call that a good thing."}
  - {rscadd: random number spawner. It's good for hull numbers that shouldn't be static.}
  - {imageadd: a really bad sprite for a service directions sign.}
  - {rscadd: Another elevator template (coincidentally demonstrating how that system
      works in code)}
