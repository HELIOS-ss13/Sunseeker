changes:
  - {rscadd: 'You can now set turrets to filter by faction, mob type, and a few more
      criteria including "dangerous only" as well as the ability to disable retaliation.'}
  - {rscadd: Turret retaliation is a lot more vengeful. Don't mess with them.}
  - {rscadd: "Turrets will now spend a short time targetting you, pointing a beam
      at you to indicate that they're doing so."}
  - {rscdel: 'Turret covers, because they sucked.'}
  - {bugfix: Turretcode is a LOT less laggy.}
  - {tweak: Turrets are now built like normal machines. The boards are currently not
      available (except through salvaging).}
  - {tweak: You can now access full turret settings from the turret control panel.}
