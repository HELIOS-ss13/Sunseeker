changes:
  - tweak: Added a deluxe hypospray to the Aegis's Lead Doctor locker, so they can
      actually use the large vials, and changes its cargo bay's tiny fans with a holofield.
  - bugfix: The Syndicate jacket inside the Aegis is no longer invisible, its Medihuds
      and First-Aid Kits are usable, and the wiring was changed so the first SMES
      recharges.
