changes:
  - tweak: The outpost cargo catalog has been recategorized entirely, and should hopefully
      be more user-friendly.
  - tweak: Access restrictions have been removed from purchased crates.
  - tweak: Purchased crates may no longer have erroneous manifests; they will now
      always contain the full contents of the purchased pack.
  - tweak: Internals and plasmaman refill crates no longer come with air; instead,
      purchase a canister of gas along with your tanks.
  - balance: Many packs have had their prices changed to better fit our ideal price-scaling.
  - balance: Material export prices have been reduced across the board, with plasma
      sheets in particular receiving a heavy nerf to their export price.
  - refactor: Cargo pack categories now exist in their own files.
