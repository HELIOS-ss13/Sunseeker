changes:
  - rscadd: new pet, soda dispenser and orion trail board, cryo pod console, on mining
      shuttle
  - tweak: moved the SMES on mining shuttle and rewired to match, theres only one
      smes now but who cares we never used the second one. this should fix some bullshit
      with the ion thruster
  - bugfix: plating put under two things on mining shuttle so that landing on planets
      would stop eating the wires and killing the solarpanels
