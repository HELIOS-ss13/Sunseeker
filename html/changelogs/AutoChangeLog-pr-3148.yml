  - {rscadd: Food storage! Hide some glass in the captains cake! Begone digestive
      tract!}
  - {rscadd: 'Bread, Cake and Spaghetti to Newfood'}
  - {rscadd: some smaller foods can now be eaten whilst on the run! (This ONLY applies
      to newfood items thus far!)}
  - {rscadd: converted edible component to work with newfood}
  - {rscdel: 'oldfood for Bread, Cake and Spaghetti'}
  - {rscdel: 'Temporarily removes customfood bread, cake, pasta, and sandwiches'}
  - {tweak: edited a few messed up values}
  - {tweak: 'food trash is sensible now. Finishing stuff like cake will actually spawn
      a plate rubbish. Instead of you eating the plate, biggun, perhaps properly dispose
      of it!'}
  - {bugfix: Wildly STUPID item weights. Candycorn and cakes are no longer the SAME
      size}
  - {code_imp: provides some semblance of sorting for signal defines}
