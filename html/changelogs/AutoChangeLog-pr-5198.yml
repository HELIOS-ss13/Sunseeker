changes:
  - {rscadd: Every deprecated instance of plating/dirt and plating/grass has 
      been updated to use their /asteroid modern counterparts. Rejoice! Pretty 
      much nothing has changed!}
  - {rscadd: 'Updates beach, jungle, and most rockplanet ruin maps to use the non-deprecated
      dirt and grass turfs.'}
  - {bugfix: Removed two duplicate sprites in jungle.dmi that were causing dirt 
      to use the wrong sprites in editor}
  - {rscdel: Every deprecated turf under /turf/open/floor/plating/dirt and 
      /turf/open/floor/plating/grass}
  - {rscdel: Removed /turf/open/floor/plating/grass. Anything that used it now 
      uses /asteroid/dirt/grass.}
