  - {tweak: 'bleeding is now stored in the limbs, functioning similarly to bone breaking.
      Taking damage over a certain threshold and amount (lower for sharp weapons)
      will cause part of it to be turned into bleeding.'}
  - {tweak: 'gauze, tape, and bleeding suppression are similarly no longer abstracted
      into a "bleed suppression" value'}
  - {rscadd: you can now cauterize bleeding with a lighter. Which is cool.}
  - {rscadd: you can now also cauterize bleeding with suit storage decontamination.
      Which is hot.}
  - {rscadd: examine and examine closely will show whether or not someone is visibly
      bleeding or bandaged. This means people who are both will show both. Examine
      closely additionally shows which limbs are currently bleeding.}
  - {tweak: 'heparin now causes existing bleeding to worsen, instead of causing bleeding
      on its own'}
  - {tweak: you can no longer cut the throat of someone who's head has been lopped
      off}
