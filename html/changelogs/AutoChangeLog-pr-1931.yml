changes:
  - rscadd: Adds new preferences to make characters fully prosthetic or a FBP (only
      difference being brain type)
  - rscadd: Lizard prosthetic/synthetic bodyparts with absolutely wonderful sprites
      by <b>Thgvr</b>! It's just a visual difference, and any species can use them,
      but they most resemble lizards, so.
  - rscadd: Adds missing robotic vox bodyparts
  - tweak: All species have the ability to change their two mutcolours. I don't think
      this is really a loss at all.
