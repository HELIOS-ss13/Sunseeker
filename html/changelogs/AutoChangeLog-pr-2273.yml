changes:
  - bugfix: polishes out some weird smoothing interactions between some rock walls
      and metal walls
  - tweak: indestructible rock walls now have the new, smoothed sprites
  - tweak: beach rockwalls now have a whimsical name & description, matching our other
      rock walls.
  - bugfix: removes the junk 'asteroid' subtype of mineral/random
