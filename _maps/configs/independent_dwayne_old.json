	"description": "The Dwayne is one of the older classes of ships commonly seen on the Frontier, and one of the few such classes that doesnâ€™t also carry a reputation for nightmarish conditions or high accident rates. This is the original Mark.I model, only used by Nanotrasen captains. It comes with 2 'Rock-Class' shuttles used for rapid mining and transport on astroids, though never designed for planet landings. These show up in lower and lower numbers over time, as more and more are converted to the Mark.IIs",
