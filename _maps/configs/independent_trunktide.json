	"description": "The “Tide” is not a singular class so much as a broad category of makeshift spacecraft cobbled together from a wide variety of salvage sources. Their crews are as diverse as the ships themselves, but, as a rule, are impoverished, resourceful, and unstable. Ships of this type were nearly unheard of prior to the ICW, but slowly grew more and more common as the war progressed, occasionally bearing recognizable elements of Nanotrasen and Syndicate space stations. The flood of these unpainted metal hulks across the Frontier and, by extension, their unpredictable crews, came to be referred to as the Grey Tide.",
