	"description": "Originally a cargo transport vessel, the Tortuga class is an improvised combat vessel under the ranks of the Frontiersmen fleet. Clever field modifications include the conversion of the cargo bay to a hangar, and additional padding around the ship in the form of asteroid rocks. It serves a dual purpose, both as a capable ship for establishing a military enclave in a sector, and as a sturdy vessel for reconnaissance. The nimble Brawler-class subshuttle of the Tortuga is offset by its very low overall mobility and loss of operation if the subshuttle were to be lost.",
