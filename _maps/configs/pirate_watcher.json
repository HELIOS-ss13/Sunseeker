	"description": "The Watcher class is an improvised combat vessel under the ranks of the Frontiersmen fleet. It serves a dual purpose, both as a capable ship for establishing a military enclave in a sector, and as a sturdy vessel for reconnaissance. The nimble subshuttle of the Watcher is offset by its very low overall mobility and loss of operation if the subshuttle were to be lost.",
