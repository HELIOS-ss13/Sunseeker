	"description": "The \"Pill-Class\", commonly called a Torture Device, is the absolute bare minimum of what would constitute a spacecraft. Often created by prisoners desperate to escape confinement, odds of survival within these crafts is minimal. Still, there have been a fair few who have managed to survive and modify their \"Pill\" into something quite a bit more space worthy. Either that or the prisoners get picked up by a sympathetic crew. Better than dying to a goliath you landed right next to. ",
