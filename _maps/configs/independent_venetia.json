	"description": "The Venetia-class is one of the upper-ends of Kasagi-Fischer Partnership vessels, often captained by richer frontier residents. Due to the recent scrap-craze of the frontier, many of these Superyachts have been sold with salvaging in mind, and due to the danger of this work, some higher-end mercenaries can be found on these vessels. With the many accommodations inside these ships, it's not uncommon to see a passenger compliment, there for frontier sightseeing or research."
