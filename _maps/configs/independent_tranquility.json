	"description": "While most vessels have some form of clear utility in mind – research, mining, cargo hauling, and so on – the Tranquility-class is a notable exception to this rule. The Tranquility is, fittingly, a fairly calm and level-headed affair, modeled around traditional apartment complexes. Fitted with several independent quarters, a large communal canteen and very little in the way of industrial equipment or self-defense tools, Tranquility-classes are often found cruising lazily around the Frontier, getting up to sitcom-esque antics and eschewing the more focused approach of many of their contemporaries.",
