	"description": "The Solar-class is one of the most commonly found ships in sectors not controlled by a large governing body. Both cheap to produce and easily accessible in most ship consumer markets, the Solar-class finds itself purchased commonly by new captains. The Solar was paired with a savvy marketing campaign, pitching it to prospective new pilots and shipowners as a quote “Research Vessel”, which was false advertisement by all means. Because of its history, the Solar’s name has become synonymous with manufacturing laziness.",
