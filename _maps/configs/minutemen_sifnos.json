	"description": "The Sifnos-class is a mining vessel utilized by the MELD division of CLIP. Although the original design was intended as a freighter, modern production runs have turned the Sifnos's purpose to mining minerals. The inclusion of a mineral processing array where there was once cargo racks allows on-site refinement, and the small crew compliment allows it to deploy into sectors of space a more specialized vessel (such as the Vela) would be unsuitable. This has made it quite a common sight in the frontier.",
