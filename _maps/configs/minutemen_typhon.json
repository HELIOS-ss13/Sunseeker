	"description": "The Atlas-Class is the designation for some of the oldest serving vessels in the Confederated League's military fleet. Originally the Atlantas-class, the design of the Atlantas was taken by the Colonial Militia just before the beginning of the war with the Old Frontiersmen, playing a pivotal role in multiple skirmishes. It is small in size and crew, well-rounded, and well-suited as an unexpensive hit-and-run vessel. Despite its age, the Atlas continues to serve the Confederated League for peacekeeping missions and driving off small crews of pirates from colonies.",
